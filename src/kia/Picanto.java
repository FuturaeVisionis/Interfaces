/*
The keyword extends is used to inherit a class or an interface!
It is also called subclassing / sub interfacing.
In this case, Panda is the SUPER interface!
The interface Picanto is called the sub interface, derived, extended or child interface.

Also interesting to note is that interfaces EXTEND and classes IMPLEMENT.
A class can EXTEND, but then it has to be abstract.
